  I have spent my whole life engaging with technology one way or another. When I
  was little I would spend hours tinkering and exploring. During the Great
  Recession I studied economics at university, paying my way by helping others
  solve their technology problems. After graduating I left the helpdesk behind
  to embark on a new adventure: Teaching myself how to code.

  For half a year I delivered mail by day and tackled tutorials by night. I
  built my first website through pure trial, error and grit. I shared what I had
  built with the community and it was a hit! My site received over ten thousand
  visits that weekend and I was hooked. I dedicated as much time as I could to
  learning - getting married tends to distract - and soon began to write code
  professionally.
</p>

<p>
  From those humble beginnings I've worked hard to amass seven years of
  professional experience. I got my feet wet at a startup then spent a few years
  as a technical consultant followed by a year and a half working as a staff
  application developer acting in a team lead capacity. I voluntarily left this
  last position to focus on some personal matters - getting divorced tends to
  distract - and now I'm refreshed and ready for the next step in this
  adventure.

  Take a look at my Resume if you'd like to learn more about my professional
  experience. The CLRS section of this site contains much of my self-directed
  learning in the form of solutions to many exercises from the 3rd edition
  Introduction to Algorithms textbook by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
  Thanks for visiting and I hope you enjoy learning more about me and my
  journey!
