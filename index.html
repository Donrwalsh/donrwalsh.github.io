  I have been fascinated by technology since childhood, always curious about how
  things work and how they can be improved. During the Great Recession I
  supported myself through college by helping others solve their tech problems.
  That experience gave me a practical education that shaped the way I approach
  challenges.

  After college I worked long days delivering mail and spent nights teaching
  myself to code. My first website was built through pure trial, error and grit.
  When it unexpectedly drew more than ten thousand visits in a single weekend I
  knew I had found my path.

  Over the past seven years I have built experience in startups, consulting, and
  application development teams. I have taken on leadership responsibilities,
  collaborated closely with colleagues, and grown my skills through real-world
  projects. These years have taught me the value of persistence and
  adaptability, both in technology and in life.

  Take a look at my Resume if you'd like to learn more about my professional
  experience. The CLRS section of this site contains much of my self-directed
  learning in the form of solutions to many exercises from the 3rd edition
  Introduction to Algorithms textbook by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
  Thanks for visiting and I hope you enjoy learning more about me and my
  journey!
