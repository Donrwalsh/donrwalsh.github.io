### Thoughts

This is a disorganized smattering of keywords. I think this worked pretty well for me during the beginning of my career, but as of now there's a bit too much happening here for it to be helpful. I'm not sure how best to organize this right away. What makes most sense is to organize the data in a way that makes sense to my brain and then later I can represent that data on my resume in whatever way makes sense for the resume at hand. So how about I do it by language?

Ooh, this makes sense to do on the resume.html page.

## By Language

### JavaScript

### TypeScript

#### Angular
