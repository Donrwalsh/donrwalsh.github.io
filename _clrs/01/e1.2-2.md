**Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size *n*, insertion sort runs in 8*n*<sup>2</sup> steps, while merge sort runs in 64*n*lg*n* steps. For which values of *n* does insertion sort beat merge sort**

First of all, 8*n*<sup>2</sup> < 64*n*lg*n* reduces to *n* < 8lg*n*. Next I used `sort_compare.py` to determine when insertion sort overtakes merge sort, which is at *n* = 43. (hilariously, this script wasn't doing what I wanted it to until I set n to start at 2 instead of 1)

**sort_compare.py:**

```python
import math

n = 2
while True:
    if n < 8 * math.log2(n):
        print("for n = " + str(n) + ", merge sort beats insertion sort")
    else:
        print("for n = " + str(n) + ", insertion sort wins!")
        break
    n += 1
```
