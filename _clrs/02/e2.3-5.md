**Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence *A* is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against *v* and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The *binary search* algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is θ(lg*n*).**

BINARY-SEARCH(*A*, *v*)

*i* = 0

*j* = ceiling(*A*.length/2)

if *A*[*j*] = *v* { *i* += *j* }

else if *A*[*j*] < *v* { *i* += *j* + BINARY-SEARCH(*A*[*j* + 1,...,*n*]) }

else if *A*[*j*] > *v* { *i* += BINARY-SEARCH(*A*[1,...,*j* - 1]) }

return *i*

Intuitively, the worst-case scenrio for BINARY-SEARCH is when *v* does not exist in *A* at all. In which case we halve the array as many times as possible, which takes θ(lg*n*).
