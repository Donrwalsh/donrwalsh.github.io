title:  "Problem 2-1"

**Although merge sort runs in θ(*n*lg*n*) worst-case time and insertion sort runs in θ(*n*²) worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to *coarsen* the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which *n*/*k* sublists of length *k* are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where *k* is a value to be determined.**

***a.* Show that insertion sort can sort the *n*/*k* sublists, each of length *k*, in θ(*nk*) worst-case time.**

Sorting a sublist of length *k* takes θ(*k*²), so sorting *n*/*k* such sublists takes θ((*n*/*k*)*k*²) = θ(*nk*) worst-case time.

***b.* Show how to merge the sublists in θ(*n*lg(*n*/*k*)) worst-case time.**

The MERGE procedure takes θ(*n*) time, and we must merge 2 sublists at a time which takes θ(lg(*n*/*k*)) time. Altogether, this will take θ(*n*lg(*n*/*k*)) worst-case time.

***c.* Given that the modified algorith runs in θ(*nk* + *n*lg(*n*/*k*)) worst-case time, what is the largest value of *k* as a function of *n* for which the modified algorithm has the same running time as standard merge sort, in terms of θ-notation?**
