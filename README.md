This is my homepage. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Connected Repos

More on this later... (including which content is shared)

Styles for all connected repos are managed here by way of `styles.scss` which imports further files also held in this repo. The `CLRS` project pulls in these exact same styles and the intent is for the experience of this site to be seamless despite the code being distributed across multiple repos.
