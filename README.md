Installed Ruby (https://rubyinstaller.org/)

Installed Bundler (https://bundler.io/)

>jekyll new . 

Made changes suggested in the Gemfile

>bundle exec jekyll serve

^ wasn't working, so I needed to do:

>bundle update

>bundle install

Then site available at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

Adding content https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll

Jekyll documentation https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

^ This has a much simpler getting started approach which I like. What I had before seemed to be a template? It was very busy.
