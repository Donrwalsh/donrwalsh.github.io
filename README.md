https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33113945/can-jekyll-use-a-config-file-from-a-different-repo <- Didn't have a ton of luck trying this out.

It would be swell to share assets such as templates between different repos so I can link out to CLRS stuff without pulling it in here.

^ This doesn't seem to be in the cards. I am going to roll my CLRS repo into this repo instead.

This looks cool for a readme template: https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/blob/master/README.md
